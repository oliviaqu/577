# The Single Neuron Logistic Regression Model

## Definition

In some machine learning classification problems, it is difficult to make some direct and clear classfication because of overlapping. In this case, we consider the probabilistic binary classfication problem. Instead of creating a single neuron model for predicting a class deterministic label, we will next build a single neuron model that predicts a class probability.

The dataset used is palmerpenguins which contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

In this single neuro logistic regression model, we label the 'Adelie' and 'Gentoo' species, using the 'bill depth[mm]' and 'flipper length[mm]' as features to train the model.
