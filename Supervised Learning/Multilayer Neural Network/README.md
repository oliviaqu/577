# Multilayer Neural Network

## Introduction

A multilayer neural network (or multilayer perceptron ,MLP) is a class of feedforward artificial neural network (ANN). 
A multilayer neural network is multilayer of perceptrons. It consists an input layer, several hidden layers, output layer, fully connected weights and non-linear activation function. 

It uses two kinds of gradient descent methods

# DATASET

Fashion MNIST Dataset

The Fashion MNIST data set (from keras) is a wide-used multi-class image classification dataset. 
The dataset has 60,000 training data with 28x28 grayscale images and 10,000 test images. Images are labeled over 10 categories.
The pixel depth allows 255 different intensities, with 0 being black and 255 being white. And the classes are: T-shirt/top, Trouser, Pullover, Dress, Coat, Sandal, Shirt, Sneaker, Bag, and Ankle boot with labels 0 to 9 respectively.
