## The Single Neuron Linear Regression Model

### Definition

The single neuron model together with the gradient descent algorithm to get the single neuron linear regression model in order to solve the linear regression problem.

### Gradient Descent Alogrithm

 In a general manor, gradient descent can now be defined in a meaningful sense:

w \leftarrow w - \alpha \nabla f(w) \:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\:\: (\text{True Gradient Descent})
