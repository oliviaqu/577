## The Single Neuron Linear Regression Model

### Definition

The single neuron model together with the gradient descent algorithm to get the single neuron linear regression model in order to solve the linear regression problem.

### Gradient Descent Alogrithm

Gradient descent (GD) is an iterative first-order optimisation algorithm used to find a local minimum/maximum of a given function. This method is commonly used in machine learning (ML) and deep learning(DL) to minimise a cost/loss function (e.g. in a linear regression).

* Learning Rate 
The choice of learning rate(alpha) in machine learning is typically found by experimentation, though more sophesticated techniques are available, such as line-search and trust-region methods (again see Nocedal & Wright).

### Linear Regression

In this notebook we will focus on linear regression. This specific case of regression assumes that the target values in  are approximated by a linear function of the associated feature vectors. That is, the optimal target function f: X->Y  is assumed the be roughly a linear function.

## DATASET 

The dataset used is palmerpenguins which contains size measurements for three penguin species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.
